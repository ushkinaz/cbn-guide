# Architecture Decision Records

This directory contains Architecture Decision Records (ADRs) documenting significant architectural decisions made in the project.

## What is an ADR?

An Architecture Decision Record captures an important architectural decision made along with its context and consequences. See [Lightweight Architecture Decision Records](https://github.com/peter-evans/lightweight-architecture-decision-records) for more information.

## Creating a New ADR

1. Use the [create-adr workflow](../../.agent/workflows/create-adr.md): `/create-adr`
2. Or manually copy [000-template.md](000-template.md) and follow the structure
